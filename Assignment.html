		<h1>Himalayan</h1>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.petfinder.com/cat-breeds/himalayan/">
The Himalayan is a hybrid breed identical to the Persian, but distinguished by the points on the catsâ€™ extremities (the facial mask, feet, ears, and tail) which results in a Persian-type cat with the coloring and deep blue eyes of the Siamese-patterned cat. The ideal Himalayan is a strong cat with excellent boning and musculature, a well-balanced cat, giving the impression of robust power.
